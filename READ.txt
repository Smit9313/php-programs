specific differences between GET and POST:

Data size: GET method has a limitation on the amount of data that can be sent, 
            which is typically around 2000 characters. POST method does not have
            any size limitations.
Security: POST method is considered more secure than GET method because the data 
            is not visible in the URL. However, POST method does not provide absolute 
            security and can still be subject to attacks such as cross-site scripting 
            (XSS) or SQL injection.
Caching: GET method can be cached, meaning that the same request can be made multiple 
            times without actually sending a new request to the server. POST method 
            cannot be cached, so each request will send the data to the server.
